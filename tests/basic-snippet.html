    <p>
      In this excercise, I will make sense of each element provided in the code snippet pictured below.

  <h2>
    Tags
  </h2>
    <p>
      There are two tags here, the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_p.asp"> paragraph tag</a> using p and the <a href= "https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp"> hyperlink tag</a> using a. In this example, the a tag is a child of the p. The first p tag opens the paragraph while the last one closes the tag. On the a tag we first have an attribute named href with value google.com. This attribute defines which page to open when clicked. Next, we have an attribute named id which makes it easy to reference this link element from elsewhere either in the html or script; it has the id value "the-best-link". Then, we have the class element which also makes it so we can call this element from other parts of the code but this is a broader scope than the id. It is currently set to the "banana" class. The target attribute tells the computer where to open the file. By filling this attribute with "blank" we are telling the computer to open the link in a new window or tab.
