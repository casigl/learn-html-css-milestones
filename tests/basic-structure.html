    Smash Mouth - All Stars
  </h1>
  <p>
          Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
      I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
      She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
      In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
      Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
      Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
      Didn't make sense not to live for fun
      Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
      So much to do, so much to see
      So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
      You'll never know if you don't go
      You'll never shine if you don't glow
      Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
      Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
      And all that glitters is gold
      Only shooting stars break the mold
      It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
      You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
      But the meteor men beg to differ
      Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
      The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
      The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
      My world's on fire, how about yours?
      That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
      Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
      Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
      All that glitters is gold
      Only shooting stars break the mold
      Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
      Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
      And all that glitters is gold
      Only shooting stars
      Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
      I need to get myself away from this place
      I said, "Yup" what a concept
      I could use a little fuel myself
      And we could all use a little change
      Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
      Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
      Didn't make sense not to live for fun
      Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
      So much to do, so much to see
      So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
      You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
      You'll never shine if you don't glow
      Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
      Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
      And all that glitters is gold
      Only shooting stars break the mold
      And all that glitters is gold
      Only shooting stars break the mold

    Michael Bolton - I Can Go the Distance
  </h2>
  <p>
          I have often dreamed of a far off place
      Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
      Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
      And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be
      I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
      I will find my way if I can be strong
      I know every mile would be worth my while
      When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong
      Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
      Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
      And a thousand years would be worth the wait
      It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through
      And I won't look back, I can go the distance
      And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
      It's an uphill slope
      But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
      And my journey is complete, oh yeah
      But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
      For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh
      Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
      I will search the world, I will face its harms
      I don't care how far, I can go the distance
      'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms
      I will search the world, I will face its harms
      'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms
  </p>
